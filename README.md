Itty Bitty Bitcoin
==================
Copyright (c) Björn Edström <be@bjrn.se> 2011.

Work in progress implementation of BitCoin. Written because I want to
know how it works.

Tools
-----

`itty-tracker`: Tracks and manages seed nodes (the initial peers used to learn about the network) in the BitCoin network.

Modules
-------

`itty.util.base58`: Reference implementation of the base58 encoding
used by BitCoin. Extensively tested.
